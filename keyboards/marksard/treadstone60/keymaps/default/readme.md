# The default keymap for Treadstone60

This keymap supports both US and Japanese keymaps.  
List the other points.  

- To support HHKB layout, CapsLock can be pressed and held to become Control key.
- In the Japanese keyboard environment, the right shift key is short-pressed to become the _ key.
- The keycode specific to the Japanese keyboard is packed into the US layout to avoid keys that cannot be pressed by the OS keymap.
